The Pretty Table library is built using *ReactJS* and is available 

Its structure follows the React basics recommendations, using specific folders for pages, components, and assets. The `App.jsx` file allows us to configure the *React Router* while the `Main.jsx` file displays the app on the page's `<body>`.

At this stage of the app development, which is still early, the structure is not fixed and may change based on upcoming development steps.
